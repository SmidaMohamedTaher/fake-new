       "'بيونسيه تتضاعف... لأول مرة #lemonade، أغنية أخرى لاستدراج العرق، كراهية الشرطيين، مؤيدة لأوباما... مع والدة مايكل براون الجميلة وسيرينا ويليامز، سيكون معظم العالم مهووسًا بإصدار بيونسيه الجديد، عصير الليمون بسبب اعترافها غير المتوقع بأنها متزوجة من خنزير غشاش. لقد اخترنا بدلاً من ذلك التركيز على الجهود المستمرة التي يبذلها الثنائي العنصري الديناميكي لتعزيز عدم الثقة والكراهية تجاه رجال إنفاذ القانون لدينا، بينما نساعد صديقهم العزيز باراك أوباما على تعزيز الانقسام العنصري في أمريكا. إن تصوير بيونسيه لنفسها كقديسة تقود النساء إلى المعمودية أمر مثير للضحك بالنظر إلى رسائل الكراهية والخلاف التي تواصل الترويج لها في أغانيها. لقد أصبحت مجرد أداة لأوباما وحياة السود مهمة للجماعة الإرهابية. أي شخص يشتري موسيقاها من شركة زوجها العنصرية فهو يساهم بشكل مباشر في الكراهية. ظهرت والدا ترايفون مارتن ومايكل براون في الألبوم الجديد لبيونسيه، والذي تم إصداره على خدمة جاي زي تيدال للبث المباشر مساء السبت بعد عرض خاص على قناة HBO للترويج له. عصير الليمون هو عنوان الألبوم الأول للمغنية منذ ثلاث سنوات، والألبوم المرئي الذي تم بثه على قناة HBO للترويج له. واستمرت المغنية في ربط أعمالها برسالة سياسية، فضلاً عن مهاجمة زوجها جاي زي وسط شائعات عن الخيانة الزوجية، بينما بدت في النهاية وكأنها تسامحه. كان الفيلم الذي تم بثه على شبكة HBO بمثابة تحية جريئة لمثابرة النساء الأميركيات من أصول أفريقية وحركة حياة السود مهمة. ووجهت ملكة البوب موضوعًا في وقت مبكر من عصير الليمون بينما يقطع الفيلم مقتطفًا من زعيم الحقوق المدنية الراحل مالكولم إكس، الذي يُسمع وهو يقول: \"الشخص الأكثر احترامًا في العالم\" أمريكا هي المرأة السوداء. في وقت لاحق، شوهدت والدة مايك براون، ليزلي ماكسبادين، وهي تبكي وهي تحمل صورة لابنها الراحل، الذي أثار مقتله بالرصاص على يد ضابط شرطة في فيرجسون بولاية ميسوري في عام 2014 احتجاجات وتحقيقات وزارة العدل. كما شوهدت والدة ترايفون مارتن، سيبرينا فولتون وهي تحمل صورة ابنها، الذي قُتل بالرصاص عندما كان يبلغ من العمر 17 عامًا على يد جورج زيمرمان، في قضية أثارت غضبًا وطنيًا في 2012. بعد عرضه على HBO، سيكون الألبوم متاحًا فقط على Tidal، واشتراك Jay Z المدفوع مقابل الموسيقى. ومع ذلك، ستعرض شبكة HBO إعادة العرض يوم الأحد 24 أبريل الساعة 8 مساءً بالتوقيت الشرقي. ومن المعروف أن بيونسيه أصبحت سياسية بموسيقاها، فقد أثارت جدلاً في السوبر بول بعد أن ارتدت هي وراقصوها ملابس مشابهة لحزب النمر الأسود، والذي كان معروفًا بمواجهته مع الضباط. قبل السوبر بول، أصدرت بيونسيه تشكيلًا ورافقت الأغنية بمقطع فيديو يتماشى مع حركة حياة السود المزدهرة ضد وحشية الشرطة، مع مشهد واحد يظهر الضباط وهم يرفعون أيديهم إذا كانت قيد الاعتقال، فقد نال الفيديو إشادة واسعة من الناشطين وقاعدة المعجبين ببيونسيه، على الرغم من أن تحولها السياسي أثار غضب بعض المحافظين. وقالت بيونسيه، وهي واحدة من أنجح الفنانين المعاصرين الذين تجنبوا الجدل في الماضي، في مقابلة لاحقة إنها كانت تتعامل مع الانتهاكات، وليس مع جميع الشرطة. ملكة البوب، التي تبدأ جولتها العالمية في التشكيل الشهر المقبل، أصبحت سياسية مرة أخرى في الألبوم المرئي. ضحايا وحشية الشرطة والعنف المسلح. وشوهدت والدة مايك براون، ليزلي ماكسبادين، وهي تبكي وهي تحمل صورة لابنها الراحل، الذي أثار مقتله بالرصاص على يد ضابط شرطة في فيرغسون بولاية ميسوري في عام 2014 احتجاجات وتحقيقات وزارة العدل. كما شوهدت والدة ترايفون مارتن، سيبرينا فولتون وهي تحمل صورة ابنها، الذي قُتل بالرصاص عندما كان يبلغ من العمر 17 عامًا على يد جورج زيمرمان، في قضية أثارت غضبًا وطنيًا. غضب عام 2012. في مقطع آخر، تغني بيونسيه عن كسر قيودها والتحرر. وفي فاصل من الكلمات المنطوقة، يتحدث شاب أمريكي من أصل أفريقي عن كيف ألهمه الرئيس أوباما. كما تضمنت عصير الليمون مقاطع لبيونسيه الصغيرة مع والدها ماثيو نولز. تجلس بيونسيه بجانبه على الأريكة ويتبادلان عبارة \"أحبك\". يبدأ الفيلم بذكر والدها، حيث تهمس بيونسيه: أين تذهب عندما تصمت؟ تذكرني بوالدي، الساحر، القادر على التواجد في مكانين في وقت واحد. في تقاليد الرجال، في دمي، تعود إلى المنزل في الثالثة صباحًا وتكذب علي. ماذا تخفي؟ هي تهمس. وهي تشير عدة إشارات واضحة إلى عاشق غير مخلص قبل أن يظهر زوجها جاي زي وهي تغني عن التسامح. في المسار الرابع من الألبوم بعنوان آسف، تغني بيونسيه: الأصابع الوسطى لأعلى ، ارفعوا أيديهم عالياً. لوّح بها في وجهه، قل له، يا فتى، إلى اللقاء. قل له، يا فتى، وداعاً، ارفع أصابعك الوسطى. أنا لا أفكر فيك وتختتم: من الأفضل أن ينادي بيكي ذات الشعر الجيد. أثار المشهد غضب المشاهدين والمستمعين، حيث غمرت آلاف التعليقات تويتر حول هذه البيكي المراوغة. وفي غضون دقائق، أصبح #beckywiththegoodhair رائجًا على تويتر. وبينما كانت تجلس على البيانو بمفردها، رأى المشاهدون مشاهد استرجاعية لحفل زفافها من جاي زي في عام 2008، وهما مستلقيان على السرير معًا. والدي حذرني من الرجال مثلك، وهي تغني. تسبب في كل وعد، لا تسير بهذه الطريقة. لا شيء يبدو أنه يؤذي مثل الابتسامة على وجهك. في وقت ما كانت تغني هل تخونني؟ ثم قالت لاحقًا إنها تشعر بالغيرة والجنون. لاحقًا ظهر الزوجان معًا وهي تغني: عمدني. الآن بعد أن أصبحت المصالحة ممكنة، إذا أردنا أن نشفى، فليكن مجيدا. وأظهر مقطع آخر الزوجين وهما يحصلان على وشم رابع متطابق على أصابعهما تكريمًا لابنتهما بلو آيفي. ولكن أي شخص يريد إعادة مشاهدته سيتعين عليه تنزيل Tidal، الذي يحمل الحقوق الحصرية للألبوم بأكمله. Tidal، الذي يكلف 9.99 دولارًا شهريًا، هو محاولة جاي زي لمنافسة الخدمات المجانية مثل Spotify وyoutube، والتي يدعي أنها لا تقدر محتوى الفنانين. تم إنشاؤها في أوائل عام 2015 بعد أن اشترى جاي زي الشركة من مؤسسيها السويديين. عبر: البريد اليومي'"
